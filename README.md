# Pytorch implementation of "Learning Pose Estimation for UAV Autonomous Navigation andLanding Using Visual-Inertial Sensor Data" [Under Construction] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.04527.pdf)

## More detailed readmy will be uploaded soon. 
### In the meanqhile check Notebook.ipynb for more details about the implementation

## Please Download the EuRoC MAV dataset at https://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets
